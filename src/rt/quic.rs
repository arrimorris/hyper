//! Generic QUIC transport support.
//!
//! HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 both run over a single, ordered byte stream, which hyper
//! abstracts with the [`Read`](super::Read) and [`Write`](super::Write) traits.
//! HTTP/3 cannot: QUIC multiplexes independent streams *inside* the transport,
//! so a connection is no longer a pair of byte pipes. It is a thing that
//! streams can be opened on and accepted from.
//!
//! This module is that abstraction. Implement these traits for a QUIC
//! implementation — [quinn], [s2n-quic], [quiche], anything — and hyper can
//! speak HTTP/3 over it without ever depending on it.
//!
//! # Connection migration
//!
//! Nothing in this module names a socket address, and hyper never caches one.
//! A QUIC connection is identified by its Connection ID, not by the 4-tuple, so
//! a peer that changes network — a phone moving from Wi-Fi to cellular, a
//! laptop switching access points — keeps the same connection, the same
//! streams, and the same in-flight requests. Implementations are expected to
//! let that happen underneath hyper: an address change is not a connection
//! error and must not be reported as one. Likewise, a connection that is merely
//! *idle* (a peer out of coverage for minutes) must keep returning
//! [`Poll::Pending`] rather than an error, until the transport's own idle
//! timeout actually expires.
//!
//! # Stability
//!
//! This API is **unstable**. It requires both the `http3` feature and
//! `--cfg hyper_unstable_quic`, and may change in any release.
//!
